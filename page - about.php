								<h2>About Arden's Automotive Hospital</h2>

								<p>
									Arden’s Automotive Hospital brings you three generations of auto repair experience. Arden’s originally opened in 1959 by Arden George Todd, who specialized in
									transmission repairs. In 1992, Arden James Todd took over his father's business keeping true to the transmission repair roots that his father had established.
								</p>
								<p>
									As time went on, Arden’s began branching out from transmission work to encompass all auto repairs. Arden's became a full-service auto
									repair shop, servicing all makes and models in the Oshkosh area.
								</p>
								<p>
									2016 brought along the third generation in the family as Alex Arden Todd reopened the business and took over where his grandfather and
									father had left off. After Alex took over, the founding principles of fairness and honesty remain the driving force behind
									Arden’s Automotive Hospital.
								</p>

								<p>
									Need help with your auto repairs? Stop in or contact Arden’s with all of your auto repair needs and experience the family
									oriented and honest service that has been driving Arden’s for almost 60 years.
								</p>
